# Assault And Battery Cycle
A Minecraft Bukkit plugin for the [Reddit UHC](https://www.reddit.com/r/ultrahardcore/) scenario
[Assault and Battery Cycle](https://redd.it/4aicpc)
made by [/u/Sean081799](https://www.reddit.com/user/Sean081799).

When PvP is enabled, the game switches between 3 cycles every 2 minutes:

- **Melee:** During the Melee cycle, direct player damage can only be dealt via melee attacks.
- **Ranged:** During the Ranged cycle, direct player damage can only be dealt via ranged attacks.
- **iPvP:** During the iPvP cycle, players cannot damage each other directly at all.

### Usage

**This plugin uses ghowden/Eluinhost's flagcommands.**

This plugin is also available as a [compact script](http://pastebin.com/raw/CtrpgeLN) for the
[Skript](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/skript/) plugin.
However, **the script version is not supported** and will likely not receive any bugfixes.
